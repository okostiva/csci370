      <h1>Google Will Pay $22.5 Million to Settle FTC Charges it Misrepresented Privacy Assurances to Users of Apple's Safari Internet Browser</h1>

      <h2>Privacy Settlement is the Largest FTC Penalty Ever for Violation of a Commission Order</h2>

  

    <p>Google Inc. has agreed to pay a record $22.5 million civil  penalty to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it misrepresented to users  of Apple Inc.’s Safari Internet browser that it would not place tracking “cookies”  or serve targeted ads to those users, violating an earlier privacy settlement between  the company and the FTC.</p>
    <p>      The settlement  is part of the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/reporter/privacy/privacypromises.shtml">FTC’s  ongoing efforts make sure companies live up to the privacy promises they make  to consumers</a>, and is the largest penalty the agency has ever obtained for a  violation of a Commission order. &nbsp;In  addition to the civil penalty, the order also requires Google to disable all  the tracking cookies it had said it would not place on consumers’ computers. &nbsp;<br>
      </p>
    <p>“The record setting penalty in this matter sends a clear  message to all companies under an FTC privacy order,” said Jon Leibowitz,  Chairman of the FTC.&nbsp; “No matter how big  or small, all companies must abide by FTC orders against them and keep their  privacy promises to consumers, or they will end up paying many times what it  would have cost to comply in the first place.”</p>
    <p>      Google, the developer of the world’s most popular  Internet search engine, generates billions of dollars in revenues annually from  selling online advertising services, including the delivery of targeted ads  online. &nbsp;Cookies are small pieces of computer  text that are used to collect information from computers and can be used to serve  targeted ads to consumers.&nbsp; By placing a  tracking cookie on a user’s computer, an advertising network can collect  information about the user’s web-browsing activities and use that information  to serve online ads targeted to the user’s interests or for other purposes.</p>
    <p>      In its complaint, the FTC charged that for several months  in 2011 and 2012, Google placed a certain advertising tracking cookie on the computers  of Safari users who visited sites within Google’s DoubleClick advertising  network, although Google had previously told these users they would automatically  be opted out of such tracking, as a result of the default settings of the  Safari browser used in Macs, iPhones and iPads.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>      According to the FTC’s complaint, Google specifically  told Safari users that because the Safari browser is set by default to block  third-party cookies, as long as users do not change their browser settings,  this setting “effectively accomplishes the same thing as [opting out of this  particular Google advertising tracking cookie].” &nbsp;In addition, Google represented that it is a  member of an industry group called the Network Advertising Initiative, which  requires members to adhere to its self-regulatory code of conduct, including  disclosure of their data collection and use practices.</p>
    <p>      Despite these promises, the FTC charged that Google placed  advertising tracking cookies on consumers’ computers, in many cases by  circumventing the Safari browser’s default cookie-blocking setting.&nbsp; Google exploited an exception to the browser’s  default setting to place a temporary cookie from the DoubleClick domain.&nbsp; Because of the particular operation of the  Safari browser, that initial temporary cookie opened the door to all cookies  from the DoubleClick domain, including the Google advertising tracking cookie  that Google had represented would be blocked from Safari browsers.</p>
    <p>      The FTC charged that Google’s misrepresentations violated  a settlement it reached with the agency in October 2011, which barred Google  from – among other things – misrepresenting the extent to which consumers can  exercise control over the collection of their information.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/1023136/111024googlebuzzdo.pdf">earlier  settlement</a> resolved FTC charges that <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2011/03/google.shtm">Google used deceptive tactics  and violated its privacy promises when it launched its social network, Google  Buzz</a>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>      More information about the FTC case can be found at the <a href="http://techatftc.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/google">Tech@FTC blog</a>.</p>
    <p>      The Commission  vote to authorize the staff to refer the complaint to the Department of  Justice, and to approve the proposed consent decree, was 4-1<strong> </strong>with Commissioner J. Thomas Rosch dissenting.&nbsp; The Commission issued a <a href="http://ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googlestatement.pdf">statement authored  by Chairman Jon Leibowitz and Commissioners Edith Ramirez, Julie Brill, and  Maureen Ohlhausen</a>. In its  statement, the Commission affirmed that the settlement is in the public  interest because, based on staff’s investigative work, there is strong reason  to believe that Google violated the prior order, and the $22.5 million fine is  an appropriate remedy for the charge that Google misrepresented to Safari  browser users how to avoid targeted advertising by Google.&nbsp; In his <a href="http://ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googleroschstatement.pdf">dissenting statement, Commissioner  Rosch</a> stated that<strong> </strong>it arguably cannot be concluded that  the consent decree is in the public interest if it contains a denial of  liability.</p>
    <p>This case was filed  with the invaluable assistance of the DOJ, which filed the complaint and  proposed consent decree on behalf of the Commission in U.S. District Court for  the District of Northern California in San Jose August 8, 2012. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>The  proposed consent decree is subject to court approval.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; The Commission refers a complaint to the DOJ  for filing when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being  violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public  interest.&nbsp; The complaint is not a finding  or ruling that the defendant has actually violated the law.&nbsp; This consent order is for settlement purposes  only and does not constitute an admission by the defendant that the law has  been violated.&nbsp; Consent orders have the  force of law when signed by the District Court judge.</p>
    <p>The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them.
